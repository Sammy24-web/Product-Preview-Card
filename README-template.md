## My process
I started off with structuring my site with HTML. Then I used CSS and bootstrap to design the site. I designed the desktop view first then I used media query for the mobile view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt the different ways to use the flexbox and other display properties like none and inline. This is helped a lot with the design of the desktop and mobile view.

section {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
}

.mobile-image {
    display: none;
}

.mobile-image {
    display: inline;
}

### Continued development

I will love to learn to design using the mobile first ideaology.
